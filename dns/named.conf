# This is a sample configuration file for the name server BIND 9.  It works as
# a caching only name server without modification.

# A sample configuration for setting up your own domain can be found in
# /usr/share/doc/packages/bind/sample-config.

# A description of all available options can be found in

	# dnssec-validation yes (default), indicates that a resolver
	# (a caching or caching-only name server) will attempt to validate
	# replies from DNSSEC enabled (signed) zones. To perform this task
	# the server also needs either a valid trusted-keys clause
	# (containing one or more trusted-anchors) or a managed-keys clause.
	# If you have problems with forwarders not returning signed responses,
	# set this to "no", but be aware that this may create security issues
	# so better switch to a forwarder which supports DNSSEC!
